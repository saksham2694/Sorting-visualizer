https://github.com/saksham2694/Sorting-visualizer/assets/71970380/55ec9c3a-6cb2-4686-8907-8cc3c8f37bc2

This React application visualizes different sorting algorithms. It allows the user to choose between four different algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. The user can also adjust the speed of the sorting and the number of elements in the array. The bars representing the elements of the array will be animated to show how the selected algorithm sorts the array.

## How to Use the App

1. Choose the sorting algorithm you want to visualize from the top bar.
2. Use the sliders to adjust the number of elements in the array and the sorting speed. The maximum number of elements is 400 and the minimum is 20.
3. Click on the "Generate New Array" button to generate a new array with random values.
